                                <h2>AD ASTRA: The Astronomy and Astrophysics club of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad </h2>
                                <p> I am the former President of AD ASTRA and in the club, I have learnt various of things, starting from event management to leadership skills. 
                                    The club has given me so many things and I will forever be grateful for my time in the club. I led and managed a team of over 50 members in 
                                    the club. We have a 9.25-inch diffraction-limited Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope which we use for stargazing and astrophotography. 

                                 </p>  

                                <h2>Public Speaking and Outreach</h2>
                                <p> I have a very outspoken nature and I really enjoy public speaking, in the form of outreach of Astronomy. I have given
                                   talks in under-privileged schools, interacting with students from grade 9 and 10. I discussed Astronomy as a career option and 
                                   how to get started with the knowledge of Astronomy. I have also given outreach talk in VIT Chennai on Neutron Star Merger Ejecta. 
                                   I have been invited by TedX Bits Hyderabad to be a speaker in their Community Meet to share experiences and inspire students with insights on personal and professional growth.
                                 </p>

								<h2>Singing</h2>
								<p>I have loved singing since I was 8 years old. It is a hobby that never really went away as I grew older. I have sung in a 
                                    lot of places, starting from school perfomances to college performances, as well. I am also very interested in Music and 
                                    if you ever want to talk about music or want some specific genre song-recommendations, feel free to contact me. Here is a 
                                    clip of me singing, I am in the right.

                                <h2>Reading Novels</h2>
								<p> When I was 7 years old, my dad introduced me to Tintin. Even though it is a comic book, I found joy, happiness, laughter, and all kinds
                                    of emotions in the books. Tintin was a rollercoaster of positive emotions for me, which led me to read a lot of mystery books such as Nancy Drew
                                    and books by Enid Blyton from a very young age. I have never stopped reading and it has always worked as a major stress buster for me. I enjoy 
                                    mystery and thriller books the most. 
                                 </p>  

                                 

                                <h2>Dancing</h2>
								<p>I have been trained in Bharanatyam, a form of Classical Dance in India for 7 years. I have enjoyed dancing since a very young
                                    age. I started learning when I was 4 years old and continued till middle school.
                                 </p>
